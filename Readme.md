A simple helloworld style plugin for minecraft.

Use as a starting point for something interesting, by itself this does very
little but made for a friend to have a starting point

To build on linux and similar systems run:
./gradlew build

On windows I assume gradlew.bat will work but can't test


After building the plugin jar will be in build/libs
